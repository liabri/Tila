A minecraft mod which improves on the very much lacking functionality of paintings. Notably by introducing a new crafting recipe for drawings and paintings, the workstation being the easel. It's slots consist of:
	1) An empty canvas (of which size matters)
	2) Tool, such as Charcoal or a Brush
	3) Dyes, depending on the colours of the drawing/painting.
	4) Binding agent, such as Oil.

The mod also introduces frames which have 3D models, these are crafting in TBA.
